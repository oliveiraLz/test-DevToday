# Project Setup

This repository contains two projects: a backend and a frontend. Both projects use `yarn` as the package manager.
In frontend project make sure your .env is correct pointing to the correct backend port
In backend the default port is 3006 but if you prefer you can change it in Main.ts of project

I Hope you like it.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version `20.17.0` is required for both projects.
- **Yarn**: Make sure you have `yarn` installed globally. You can install it by running:

```bash
npm install -g yarn


```
